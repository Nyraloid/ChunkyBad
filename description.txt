The Chunky mod is very small at the moment, but it still adds some pretty neat stuff.
Like, for instance, an armor set that essentailly erases time.

If you plan to play with this mod, I suggest using it in a modpack since it's so small right now.
Also, it has big problems in multiplayer that I don't know how to fix.
