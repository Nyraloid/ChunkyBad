Chunky currently adds JoJo inspired items and abilities, as well as some miscellanious items.

So far, from JoJo, I've included DIO and Kakyoin from part 3, King Crimson from part 5, and Mandom from part 7.

If you plan to play with this mod, I recommend including it in a modpack due to its relatively small size.

Don't try using time manipulation in multiplayer. It does not work.



Chunky does not have a homepage at the moment, but if you need to contact me I am "CHUNKY NORRIS" on the Terraria Forums.
